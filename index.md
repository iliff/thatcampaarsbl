Digital Humanities is changing the way we do research and teaching across all disciplines, and theological schools are no exception. Much of the most cutting edge work in digital humanities is being done by librarians. So, if you would like to join with others to share in learning how libraries can participate in and encourage the digital humanities, join us at THATCampATLA.

THATCamp stands for “The Humanities and Technology Camp” and exists to bring humanists and technologists of every skill level together to learn how to integrate digital technologies into their teaching and research. THATCamps are unconferences, where sessions are decided upon by participants and built around hands-on workshops and collaborative working groups rather than formal presentations. Participants are encouraged to propose sessions they would like to attend and/or facilitate in advance of the meeting. For more information on THATCamp in general, visit [their website](http://thatcamp.org/about).
