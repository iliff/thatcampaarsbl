        <p>The advent of digital technology and social media has not only transformed how religious communities function today, they have also changed how scholars teach about and conduct research on religion more broadly. If you are interested in how technology is changing—or can change—the work of religious studies scholars, then we invite you to attend the THATCamp SBL & AAR unconference!</p>

        <p>THATCamp stands for “The Humanities and Technology Camp.” It exists to bring scholars and technologists of every skill level together to learn how to integrate digital technology into their teaching and research. This means the format is not your typical conference proceedings.</p>

        <p>THATCamps are “unconferences,” which means sessions are built around hands-on workshops and collaborative working groups rather than formal presentations. Participants are encouraged to propose sessions they would like to attend in advance of the meeting. Topics we could cover include academic blogging, social media in the classroom, social media in religion, digital research methods, web-based class projects, online publishing, and countless others.</p>

        <h3>Propose a Session</h3>
        <p>There are roughly four things people do in THATCamp sessions: Talk, Make, Teach, and Play. Sometimes one session contains elements of all these, but it’s also a fair taxonomy for THATCamp sessions.

        <ul>
        	<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Talk</span> session proposal, you offer to lead a group discussion on a topic or question of interest to you.</li>
			<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make</span> session proposal, you offer to lead a small group in a hands-on collaborative working session with the aim of producing a draft document or piece of software.</li>
			<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Teach</span> session, you offer to teach a skill, either a “hard” skill or a “soft” skill.</li>
			<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Play</span> session, anything goes — you suggest literally playing a game, or you suggest some quality group playtime with one or more technologies, or what you will.</li>
		</ul>
