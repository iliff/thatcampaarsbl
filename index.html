          <h3>THATCamp ATLA</h3>

          <a href="{{base}}/2018.html" style="font-weight: bold">2018 - Indianapolis</a>
        </div>

        <p>Digital Humanities is changing the way we do research and teaching across all disciplines,
          and theological schools are no exception. Much of the most cutting edge work in digital humanities is being done by librarians.
          So, if you would like to join with others to share in learning how libraries can participate in and encourage the digital humanities,
          join us at THATCamp ATLA.</p>

        <p>THATCamp stands for “The Humanities and Technology Camp.” It exists to bring scholars and technologists of every skill level together to learn how to integrate digital technology into their teaching and research. This means the format is not your typical conference proceedings.</p>

        <p>THATCamps are “unconferences,” which means sessions are built around hands-on workshops and collaborative working groups rather than formal presentations. Participants are encouraged to propose sessions they would like to attend in advance of the meeting. Topics we could cover include academic blogging, social media in the classroom, social media in religion, digital research methods, web-based class projects, online publishing, and countless others.</p>

        <h3>Propose a Session</h3>
        <p>There are roughly four things people do in THATCamp sessions: Talk, Make, Teach, and Play. Sometimes one session contains elements of all these, but it’s also a fair taxonomy for THATCamp sessions.

        <ul>
        	<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Talk</span> session proposal, you offer to lead a group discussion on a topic or question of interest to you.</li>
			<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make</span> session proposal, you offer to lead a small group in a hands-on collaborative working session with the aim of producing a draft document or piece of software.</li>
			<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Teach</span> session, you offer to teach a skill, either a “hard” skill or a “soft” skill.</li>
			<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Play</span> session, anything goes — you suggest literally playing a game, or you suggest some quality group playtime with one or more technologies, or what you will.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To propose a session for THATCamp ATLA, go to the page for this year's event (see above) and add a comment in the disqus area of that page and inlcude the <span style="font-weight: bold;">type of session, title of session, and a brief abstract for the session.</span></p>
