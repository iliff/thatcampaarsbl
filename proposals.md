## Propose a Session ##

There are roughly four things people do in THATCamp sessions: Talk, Make, Teach, and Play. Sometimes one session contains elements of all these, but it’s also a fair taxonomy for THATCamp sessions.

- In a *Talk* session proposal, you offer to lead a group discussion on a topic or question of interest to you.
- In a *Make* session proposal, you offer to lead a small group in a hands-on collaborative working session with the aim of producing a draft document or piece of software.
- In a *Teach* session, you offer to teach a skill, either a “hard” skill or a “soft” skill.
- In a *Play* session, anything goes — you suggest literally playing a game, or you suggest some quality group playtime with one or more technologies, or what you will.
