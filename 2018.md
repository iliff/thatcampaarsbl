Below you will find the schedule for sessions this year. We will construct this schedule together and update this as needed, so check back often.

|Time       |Session|
|-----------|-------|

|1.30 - 2.20||
|3.00 - 3.45||
|3.45 - 4.30||

## Propose a Session
There are roughly four things people do in THATCamp sessions: Talk, Make, Teach, and Play. Sometimes one session contains elements of all these, but it’s also a fair taxonomy for THATCamp sessions.

+ In a **Talk** session proposal, you offer to lead a group discussion on a topic or question of interest to you.
+ In a **Make** session proposal, you offer to lead a small group in a hands-on collaborative working session with the aim of producing a draft document or piece of software.
+ In a **Teach** session, you offer to teach a skill, either a “hard” skill or a “soft” skill.
+ In a **Play** session, anything goes — you suggest literally playing a game, or you suggest some quality group playtime with one or more technologies, or what you will.

To propose a session for THATCamp ATLA, add a comment in the disqus area of this page and include the **type of session, title of session, and a brief abstract for the session.** We will also have time on the day of the event to suggest additional proposals.

## Voting for Sessions

On the day of the event, we will vote for sessions as a group and then arrange the schedule for the day. To vote for a session, scroll down to the disqus area of the event page and click on the *up vote* arrow next to the reply option by a proposal you would like to see make the schedule. If you are prompted to login, use any of the social login options to login and then your up vote will be registered. With a small group, only a half day, and a single room, we won't have time for a ton of sessions. So, only vote for your top 3 proposals and then we will tally the votes and see how we want to schedule. If we have more than 3 sessions that get lots of votes, we can split up during a time slot and offer 2 sessions.
