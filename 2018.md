> Stay tuned for embedded google sheet...

## Propose a Session
There are roughly four things people do in THATCamp sessions: Talk, Make, Teach, and Play. Sometimes one session contains elements of all these, but it’s also a fair taxonomy for THATCamp sessions.

+ In a **Talk** session proposal, you offer to lead a group discussion on a topic or question of interest to you.
+ In a **Make** session proposal, you offer to lead a small group in a hands-on collaborative working session with the aim of producing a draft document or piece of software.
+ In a **Teach** session, you offer to teach a skill, either a “hard” skill or a “soft” skill.
+ In a **Play** session, anything goes — you suggest literally playing a game, or you suggest some quality group playtime with one or more technologies, or what you will.

To propose a session for THATCamp ATLA, add a comment in the disqus area of this page and include the **type of session, title of session, and a brief abstract for the session.** We will also have time on the day of the event to suggest additional proposals.

## Voting for Sessions

On the day of the event, we will vote for sessions as a group and then arrange the schedule for the day. Stay tuned for more details on the process of voting.
