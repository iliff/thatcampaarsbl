## Propose a Session
There are roughly four things people do in THATCamp sessions: Talk, Make, Teach, and Play. Sometimes one session contains elements of all these, but it’s also a fair taxonomy for THATCamp sessions.

+ In a **Talk** session proposal, you offer to lead a group discussion on a topic or question of interest to you.</li>
<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make</span> session proposal, you offer to lead a small group in a hands-on collaborative working session with the aim of producing a draft document or piece of software.</li>
<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Teach</span> session, you offer to teach a skill, either a “hard” skill or a “soft” skill.</li>
<li>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Play</span> session, anything goes — you suggest literally playing a game, or you suggest some quality group playtime with one or more technologies, or what you will.</li>
</ul>
<p>To propose a session for THATCamp ATLA, go to the page for this year's event (see above) and add a comment in the disqus area of that page and inlcude the <span style="font-weight: bold;">type of session, title of session, and a brief abstract for the session.</span></p>
